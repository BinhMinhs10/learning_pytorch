# Introduction
## But this is just scratching the surface of what 🤗 Datasets can do! 
In this chapter, we will take a deep dive into the library. Along the way, we’ll find answers to the following questions:
* What do you do when your dataset is not on the Hub? 
* How can you slice and dice a dataset? (And what if you really need to use Pandas?)
* What do you do when your dataset is huge and will melt your laptop’s RAM? 
* What the heck are “memory mapping” and Apache Arrow? 
* How can you create your own dataset and push it to the Hub?
